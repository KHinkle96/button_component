# Custom_Button_Component #

This is a Button Component for react. This component contains four button types:
primary,
warning,
danger,
success,

These buttons can have their colors, styles, sizes, and designs changed within the css. Also the default button is set as primary so if a button throws an error in either the buttonStyle or buttonSize within the Button tag it will default to the primary button.
